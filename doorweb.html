<h1>MALTA DOORS POSTER</h1>
<br>
<h2>Malta doors is a visual blog that 
documents colourful and quirky 
facades and doors on the 
Maltese Islands. 
</h2>
<br>
<p>For this assignment, we were “commissioned”
to design a vector illustration for an A4 poster
for Malta doors in the style of Te’ fit-tazza. 

From conducting visual research of the brands,
photographing different doors around the 
island, sketching concepts for shortlisted doors
in the style, and the eventual build on Adobe 
Illustrator, the chosen door came to ‘2D life’ 
on the screen. </p>
